## Troubleshooting

### "No Employee Info" Issue
If you see "No employee info" in the credit overview:

1. **Run the update script**:
   ```bash
   node backend/scripts/updateVehicleLogsWithCustomers.js
   ```

2. **Or run the complete setup**:
   ```bash
   node run-seed.js
   ```

3. **Verify data structure**:
   ```bash
   node test-data-structure.js
   ```

### Data Population Order
1. First run: `seedCustomersAndItems.js` (creates customers and items)
2. Second run: `seedExtendedData.js` (creates vehicle logs)
3. Third run: `updateVehicleLogsWithCustomers.js` (links customers to vehicle logs)

### Expected Data Structure
After running the scripts, each vehicle log should have:
- `customerName`: Customer name (e.g., "keerthigan")
- `customerPhone`: Customer phone (e.g., "0778043115")
- `payments.credit`: Credit amount (e.g., 15000)
- `employeeName`: Employee who made the delivery
- `employeeId`: Employee ID for reference
